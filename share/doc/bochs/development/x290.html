></H2
><P
>Right now, MPU401 emulation is next to perfect. It supports UART
and SBMIDI mode, because the SB16's MPU401 ports can't do anything else as well.</P
><P
>The digital audio basically works, but the emulation is too slow for fluent
output unless the application doesn't do much in the background (or the
foreground, really). The sound tends to looping or crackle on slower
computer, but the emulation appears to be correct. Even a MOD
player works, although only for lower sampling speeds.</P
><P
>Also, the MIDI data running through the MPU401 ports can be written
into a SMF, that is the standard midi file. The wave output
can be written into a VOC file, which has a format defined by
Creative Labs. This file format can be converted to WAV by
sox for example.</P

></H2
><P
>Output is supported on Linux and Windows 95 at the moment.
On Linux, the output goes to any file or device. If you have a
wavetable synthesizer, midi can go to /dev/midi00, otherwise you may need
a midi interpreter. For example, the midid program from the
DosEmu project would work. Wave output should go to /dev/dsp.
These devices are assumed to be OSS devices, if they're not
some of the ioctl's might fail.
On Windows, midi and output goes to the midi mapper and the wave mapper,
respectively. A future version might have selectable output devices.</P

It is necessary to override all
the methods defined in the base class, unless virtual functions
are used. Note that this should remain an option, so try to
override all methods, even if only as stubs. They should be
declared <I

as usual, even though the current constructor does not do
anything yet.</P

><P
>However, many older applications don't use the auto-init DMA
mode, which means that they start a new DMA transfer for every single
block of output, which means usually for every 2048 bytes or so.
Unfortunately there is no way of knowing whether the application will
restart an expired DMA transfer soon, so that in these cases the

isn't a good idea to have it reopen the device every time.</P
><P
>The buffer when writing to the device should not be overly large.
Usually about four buffers of 4096 bytes produce best results. Smaller
buffers could mean too much overhead, while larger buffers contribute
to the fact that the actual output will always be late when the application
tries to synchronize it with for example graphics.</P

this function might be called before the previous output is done. If your
hardware can't append the new output to the old one, you will have to implement
this yourself, or the output will be very chunky, with as much silence
between the blocks as the blocks take to play. This is not what you want.
