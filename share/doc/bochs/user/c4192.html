>In the past several tweaks were necessary to install a guest OS inside of Bochs.
Nowadays it's almost the same as installing it on a real machine. There are only
a few Bochs specific issues you should know about. Note that we cannot give you
a full installation guide if you don't know how to install an OS in the real
world. The following remarks apply to all guest OS installations. Some specific
issues are reported in the next sections.
<P

><UL
><LI
><P
>First of all you need the installation media or image (floppy/CD/DVD).
For platforms that don't support raw device access it might be necessary to
create an image from the media. You must read the message regarding software
licenses in <A
HREF="x75.html"
>the Section called <I
>Third Party Software Licensing and Temporary Files</I
> in the Chapter called <I
>Introduction to Bochs</I
></A
> before you install or use a commercial
guest operating system in Bochs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Then you need to create a hard drive image with bximage. For the
required size see the documentation of the OS you'd like to install. See
<A
HREF="x4177.html"
>the Section called <I
>Using the bximage tool</I
> in the Chapter called <I
>Tips and Techniques</I
></A
> how to create the image.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Finally you have to create configuration for your guest OS. You can
edit the sample configuration distributed with Bochs or use the configuration
interface to adjust the settings. Check the documentation of your guest OS for
the required memory size, cpu speed and supported hardware.</P
></LI
></UL
>
Now you should be able to run Bochs and start the installation process. Depending
on the host cpu speed and the size of the guest OS it can take a few minutes or
even some hours.</P

>      Knoppix is a live CD (700M) or live DVD (3.2G) based on Debian GNU/Linux, with lots of
      ready-to-run programs (web browser, office suite, a few games, and more), using
      <ABBR
CLASS="ABBREV"
>KDE</ABBR
> as desktop environment. It can be booted directly from CD, without
      any installation needed. You can download it from <A

>      As Knoppix runs completely from CD/DVD, you don't need to setup a hard disk. You just need to set up
      the location of the downloaded ISO image in your <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>bochsrc</TT
>, and make Bochs boot
      from it. Because Knoppix contains a graphical user interface, and has no other storage space but
      the emulated RAM, it needs at least 128MB of it, see
      <A
HREF="x1414.html#BOCHSOPT-MEMORY"
>megs option</A
>. Furthermore, you need to enable VBE support in
      Bochs (see <A
